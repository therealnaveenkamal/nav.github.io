Working under the supervision of Prof. [Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://math.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/) and [Victor Li](https://livctr.github.io/) on NSF-funded stroke rehabilitation research at the intersection of NYU Center for Data Science and NYU School of Medicine. Investigated and benchmarked state-of-the-art video understanding models (InternVL2, NVILA, LLaVa OneVision) for precise sub-second action detection in stroke rehabilitation scenarios. We came up with a multi-stage pipeline integrating YOLO11 for human-pose detection, DINOv2 Prompt-based Object Detection, and OpenMMLab's pose estimation algorithms for motion analysis. Developed and integrated a Visual Language Model (VLM) based on video frames for improved contextual detection of patient interactions with objects, contributing to more effective and data-driven rehabilitation protocols.
