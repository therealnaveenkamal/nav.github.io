Working under the supervision of Prof. [Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://math.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/) and [Victor Li](https://livctr.github.io/) on NSF-funded stroke rehabilitation research. Contributing to the development of computer vision and machine learning methods for automated analysis of patient-therapist interactions during stroke rehabilitation sessions. Research involves benchmarking state-of-the-art multimodal models (InternVL2, NViLA, LLaVa OneVision) for fine-grained temporal action recognition in clinical settings. Developing end-to-end pipelines that combine human pose estimation (YOLO11, OpenMMLab), object detection (DINOv2), and vision-language models for comprehensive scene understanding and patient assessment in rehabilitation contexts.
