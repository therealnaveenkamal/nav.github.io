Built a fully autonomous cafeteria system that can take orders, navigate around customers, and serve food - basically a robot waiter that actually works! Used ROS2 for the core framework with RRT* and OMPL planners for navigation, integrated CNNs for object detection, and implemented SLAM for real-time mapping. The system combines computer vision for customer detection, robotic manipulation for food handling, and path planning algorithms to navigate crowded cafeteria spaces. Developed as part of [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) Robotics Developer Bootcamp.
