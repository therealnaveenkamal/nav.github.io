Developed a diagnostic model introducing Exponential Pixelating Integral transforms, fractals, and an adaptive splines-based model, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.63%. Utilized Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) ensemble model with accuracy and F1 metrics ranging from 98.46% to 99.45% and 96.53% to 98.10% respectively.
