Built an autonomous warehouse robot that knows exactly where it is and where it's going - no GPS needed! Used Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization (AMCL) combined with Cartographer SLAM to create a smart navigation system for the RB1 robot. The system generates real-time local and global costmaps for obstacle avoidance while efficiently navigating through complex warehouse environments. Implemented the complete Nav2 navigation stack with path planning, localization, and map servers to create a business-ready warehouse automation solution. Developed as part of [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) Robotics Developer Bootcamp, demonstrating practical applications of probabilistic robotics in logistics and supply chain management.
