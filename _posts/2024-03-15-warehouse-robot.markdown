Built an autonomous warehouse robot using Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization (AMCL) and Cartographer SLAM for precise positioning. Implemented Nav2 navigation stack with costmap generation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Developed with ROS2, Python, and Gazebo simulation for the RB1 robot platform.
